\title{Brewer's Method for Unequal Probability Sampling}
\usage{
up_brewer(pik, eps = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{A numeric vector of inclusion probabilities. The sum should be
an integer representing the desired sample size n.}

\item{eps}{A small threshold value. Units with \code{pik <= eps} are excluded
and units with \code{pik >= 1-eps} are always included (certainty selections).
Default is 1e-06.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of selected indices (1 to \code{length(pik)}).
}
\description{
Selects a sample using Brewer's method with unequal inclusion probabilities.
Implements Algorithm 6.10 from Tille's "Sampling Algorithms".
}
\details{
Brewer's method is a draw-by-draw procedure that selects n units with
prescribed inclusion probabilities. At each draw i, unit k is selected
with probability proportional to:

\deqn{p_k \propto \pi_k \cdot \frac{(n - a) - \pi_k}{(n - a) - \pi_k (n - i + 1)}}

where \eqn{a = \sum \pi_\ell} for already selected units.

Properties:
\itemize{
\item Fixed sample size n = \code{round(sum(pik))}
\item Exact inclusion probabilities
\item All joint inclusion probabilities \eqn{\pi_{kl} > 0}
\item Order invariant (result doesn't depend on unit ordering)
}
}
\examples{
pik <- c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8)  # sum = 2

set.seed(42)
idx <- up_brewer(pik)
idx

# Select from data frame
df <- data.frame(id = 1:4, x = c(10, 20, 30, 40))
df[idx, ]

# Verify inclusion probabilities
samples <- replicate(5000, up_brewer(pik))
indicators <- sapply(samples, function(s) 1:4 \%in\% s)
rowMeans(indicators)  # Should be close to pik
