\usage{
equal_prob_wor(
  N,
  n,
  method = c("srs", "systematic", "bernoulli"),
  nrep = 1L,
  prn = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Population size (positive integer).}

\item{n}{Expected sample size. For \code{"srs"} and \code{"systematic"}, must be
a positive integer not exceeding N. For \code{"bernoulli"}, this is the
expected sample size and \code{p = n/N} is used as the selection probability.}

\item{method}{The sampling method:
\describe{
\item{\code{"srs"}}{Simple Random Sampling. Each possible sample of size n
has equal probability. Fixed sample size.}
\item{\code{"systematic"}}{Systematic sampling with interval \code{k = N/n}.
A random start is drawn from \verb{(0, k]}. Fixed sample size.
Implicit stratification based on unit ordering.}
\item{\code{"bernoulli"}}{Bernoulli sampling. Each unit selected
independently with probability \code{p = n/N}. Random sample size.}
}}

\item{nrep}{Number of replicate samples (default 1). When \code{nrep > 1},
returns a matrix (fixed-size) or list (random-size) instead of a
design object.}

\item{prn}{Optional vector of permanent random numbers (length N,
values in the open interval (0, 1)) for sample coordination.
Only supported by \code{"bernoulli"} method.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
When \code{nrep = 1}: an object of class
\code{c("equal_prob", "wor", "sondage_sample")}.
When \code{nrep > 1}: a matrix (n x nrep) for fixed-size methods,
or a list of integer vectors for Bernoulli sampling.
}
\description{
Draws a sample with equal inclusion probabilities, without replacement.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
s <- equal_prob_wor(10, 3)
s$sample

# Systematic sampling
s <- equal_prob_wor(12, 3, method = "systematic")
s$sample

# Bernoulli sampling (random size, expected n = 30)
s <- equal_prob_wor(100, 30, method = "bernoulli")
length(s$sample)
