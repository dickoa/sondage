\title{Chromy's Sequential PPS Sampling}
\usage{
up_chromy(x, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of positive size measures (e.g., population,
revenue, area). Must be non-negative with positive sum.}

\item{n}{The sample size (number of selections).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of selected indices (1 to \code{length(x)}).
May contain repeated values when expected hits exceed 1 (minimum
replacement).
}
\description{
Selects a sample using Chromy's (1979) sequential method with probability
proportional to size. This is the default METHOD=PPS_SEQ in SAS SURVEYSELECT.
}
\details{
Chromy's method is a strictly sequential algorithm that processes units
in order and makes an immediate selection decision for each. It achieves
spatial balancing similar to systematic sampling.

Properties:
\itemize{
\item Fixed sample size n
\item Exact expected hits: \eqn{E[hits_k] = n \times x_k / \sum x}
\item Spatial balance (sample spread throughout frame)
\item O(N) time complexity (single pass)
\item All joint inclusion probabilities > 0
}

The method uses "minimum replacement": if expected hits for unit k is 2.3,
the unit appears exactly 2 or 3 times (never 0, 1, or 4+). This differs
from multinomial sampling where any count is possible.

When all expected hits are < 1 (i.e., \code{n * max(x) / sum(x) <= 1}),
the method behaves as without replacement sampling.
}
\examples{
# Size measures
x <- c(40, 80, 50, 60, 70)

# WOR case: n small relative to x
set.seed(42)
up_chromy(x, n = 3)  # No repeats

# Minimum replacement: larger n causes repeats
up_chromy(x, n = 10)  # Some units appear multiple times

# Verify expected hits
n <- 10
expected <- n * x / sum(x)
print(expected)  # 1.33, 2.67, 1.67, 2.00, 2.33

# Simulate to check
hits <- table(factor(up_chromy(x, n), levels = 1:5))
print(hits)  # Should be close to floor or ceiling of expected
