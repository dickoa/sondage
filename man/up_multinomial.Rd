\title{Multinomial Sampling (PPS with Replacement)}
\usage{
up_multinomial(x, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of positive size measures (e.g., population,
revenue, area). Must be non-negative.}

\item{n}{The number of draws (sample size).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of n selected indices (1 to \code{length(x)}).
May contain repeated values.
}
\description{
Draws n units with replacement, with selection probability proportional
to a size measure. A unit can be selected multiple times.
}
\details{
Multinomial sampling (PPS with replacement) makes n independent draws,
each with probability proportional to pik. This is equivalent to
\code{sampling::UPmultinomial()} but returns indices instead of counts.

Properties:
\itemize{
\item Fixed number of draws n = \code{round(sum(pik))}
\item Units can be selected multiple times
\item Selection probability per draw: \eqn{p_k = \pi_k / \sum \pi_k}
}

Useful for Hansen-Hurwitz estimation and bootstrap procedures.

\examples{
# Size measures
x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)

set.seed(1234)
idx <- up_multinomial(x, n = 5)
idx  # 5 indices, may repeat

table(idx)  # Unit 4 likely appears most often

# Use for selection from data frame
df <- data.frame(id = 1:4, size = x)
df[idx, ]  # 5 rows, some repeated
