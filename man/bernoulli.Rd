\title{Bernoulli Sampling}
\usage{
bernoulli(p, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Selection probability (same for all units), between 0 and 1.}

\item{N}{Population size.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of selected indices (1 to N).
Length is random with expected value \code{N*p}.
}
\description{
Each unit is independently selected with the same probability p.
Sample size is random.
}
\details{
Each unit is selected independently with probability p.

Properties:
\itemize{
\item Random sample size with expectation \eqn{Np} and variance \eqn{Np(1-p)}
\item Equal inclusion probabilities: \eqn{\pi = p}
\item Very fast: O(N) time
}
}
\examples{
# Basic usage
set.seed(42)
idx <- bernoulli(0.3, 100)
length(idx)  # Random, expected = 30

# Sample size distribution
sizes <- replicate(1000, length(bernoulli(0.3, 100)))
mean(sizes)
var(sizes)
