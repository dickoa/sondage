\title{Poisson Sampling}
\usage{
up_poisson(pik)
}
\arguments{
\item{pik}{A numeric vector of inclusion probabilities between 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of selected indices.
Length is random with expected value \code{sum(pik)}.
}
\description{
Each unit is selected independently with its own inclusion probability.
Sample size is random.
}
\details{
Poisson sampling is the simplest unequal probability method.
Each unit k is selected independently with probability \eqn{\pi_k}.

Properties:
\itemize{
\item Random sample size with expectation \eqn{\sum \pi_k}
\item Exact inclusion probabilities
\item Independent selections
\item Joint probabilities: \eqn{\pi_{kl} = \pi_k \times \pi_l}
}
}
\examples{
pik <- c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 0.3)

# Sample size varies
set.seed(1)
replicate(5, length(up_poisson(pik)))

# Expected size = sum(pik) = 1.8
mean(replicate(1000, length(up_poisson(pik))))
