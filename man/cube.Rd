\title{Cube Method for Balanced Sampling}
\usage{
cube(prob, x, strata = NULL, nrep = 1L, eps = 1e-12)
}
\arguments{
\item{prob}{Numeric vector of inclusion probabilities (length N).}

\item{x}{Matrix of balancing variables (N x p). If \code{prob} is included
as a balancing variable, the sample size will be fixed.}

\item{strata}{Optional integer vector of stratum identifiers (length N).
When provided, uses stratified cube method guaranteeing exact sample
size per stratum.}

\item{nrep}{Number of samples to draw (default: 1).}

\item{eps}{Numerical tolerance (default: 1e-12).}
}
\value{
If \code{nrep = 1}, an integer vector of selected indices.
If \code{nrep > 1}, an integer matrix with n rows and \code{nrep} columns,
where each column contains the indices for one replicate.
}
\description{
Selects balanced samples with prescribed inclusion probabilities
using the fast flight Cube Method.
}
\details{
The cube method (Deville and Tillé, 2004) selects balanced samples that
satisfy (approximately) the balancing equations:
\deqn{\sum_{k \in S} x_k / \pi_k = \sum_{k \in U} x_k}

This implementation uses the fast flight phase algorithm of Chauvet and
Tillé (2006), which processes only p+1 units at a time, achieving O(N)
complexity.

The algorithm has two phases:
\itemize{
\item Flight phase: Iteratively rounds probabilities to 0 or 1 while
maintaining exact balance, until at most p non-integer probabilities
remain.
\item Landing phase: Handles the remaining units, relaxing the balancing
constraints minimally.
}

When \code{strata} is provided, the stratified cube method is used:
\enumerate{
\item Flight per stratum: balance within each stratum
\item Global flight: balance across strata with stratum indicators
\item Landing per stratum: separate landing ensures exact n_h
}
This guarantees exact sample sizes per stratum.

For repeated sampling (simulations), use the \code{nrep} parameter instead
of a loop for better performance.

\examples{
# Basic balanced sampling
set.seed(123)
N <- 100
n <- 10
prob <- rep(n / N, N)
x <- cbind(prob, matrix(runif(N * 2), ncol = 2))
s <- cube(prob, x)
print(s)

# Stratified balanced sampling
set.seed(123)
N <- 200
strata <- rep(1:4, each = 50)
prob <- rep(10 / 50, N)  # 10 per stratum
x <- cbind(prob, runif(N))
s <- cube(prob, x, strata = strata)
table(strata[s])  # Exact 10 per stratum

#' # Batch sampling for simulations
set.seed(1)
samples <- cube(prob, x, nrep = 100)
emp_prob <- tabulate(as.vector(samples), nbins = N) / 100
